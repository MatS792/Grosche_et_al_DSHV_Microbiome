Data and code relative to the Grosche et al. 2025 manuscript about the chemosynthetic microbiome of deepsea hydrothermal vents in the East Pacific Rise. Sequences are available through the NCBI SRA archive with accession numbers PRJNA1092253 for the amplicon data and through the MG-RAST archive with accession numbers MGM4773053.3 and MGM4773182.3 for the metatranscriptomic data.

The repository contains the following files:

- README.md (this readme file)
- Grosche_et_al_16S.r (the r code to reproduce the figures)
- Grosche_et_al_metatranscriptomic.r (the r code to reproduce the figures)
- grosche_et_al_env_dataset.csv (the environmental dataset)
- a series of .csv files to replicate the figures and analyses reported in the paper
